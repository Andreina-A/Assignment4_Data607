## Introduction
**Turn the given dataset on arlines and their arrival time into a .CSV, and tidy and transform the data for further analysis. Then analyze the data to compare the delays for both airlines.**


## Data set was created in SQL, accessing the SQL database on R.

```{r}
myDB<-dbConnect(MySQL(), user='andreina.arias80', password=rstudioapi::askForPassword(prompt = 'Password: '), dbname='andreina.arias80', host='cunydata607sql.mysql.database.azure.com')
```

**Graphic image of the provided data frame**
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("~/Documents/Screenshot 2024-09-28.png")
```
The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations. Your task is to:
(1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information above.


##**Accessing the data frame from SQL and assigning the SQL data frame to a variable in R**
```{r}
Arrival=dbSendQuery(myDB,"SELECT * FROM airline_arrival")
Airline_Arrival= fetch(Arrival)
Airline_Arrival
```

You’re encouraged to use a “wide” structure similar to how the information appears above, so
that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.
(2) Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use tidyr and dplyr as needed to tidy and transform your data.

##**Tidying data by adding "Airlines and "arrivals to the headers that have a missing title and added values "Alaska" and "AM West" where it was missing**
```{r}
names(Airline_Arrival)[names(Airline_Arrival)=='Unknown']<-'Airlines'
names(Airline_Arrival)[names(Airline_Arrival)=='Unknown2']<-'Arrivals'
Airline_Arrival[2,2]<-"Alaska"
Airline_Arrival[4,2]<-"AM West"
Airline_Arrival
```

##**Created a long verse of the data frame by created a column to place all the locations instead of having the locations in their on colomn creating a wide table.**
```{r}
Airline_Arrival_Long<-Airline_Arrival%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('Los_Angeles', 'Phoenix', 'San_Diego', 'San_Francisco', 'Seattle'), names_to = "Locations", values_to = "Flight_arrival_count" )
Airline_Arrival_Long
```

(3) Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines.

##**Grouped the data for Airline and Arrivals in order to get the averages and total count of their flights arrival.**
```{r message=FALSE}
Arrival_summary_of_airlines<-Airline_Arrival_Long%>%
  group_by(Airlines, Arrivals)%>%
  summarise(Arrival_flight_count=sum(Flight_arrival_count), aver_flight_arrival=mean(Flight_arrival_count))
Arrival_summary_of_airlines

```
##**Since we will be only looking at the delays for both airlines, a dataset will be created with just the values of the airline's delayed counts **

```{r}
delayed_Airline_summary<-Arrival_summary_of_airlines|>
  filter(Arrivals=="delayed")
delayed_Airline_summary
```


##**Created a bar look at the delayed flight for each airline in different locations.**
```{r}
Airline_delay_plot<-Airline_Arrival_Long%>%
         filter(Arrivals=="delayed")
ggplot(Airline_delay_plot,aes(Locations, Flight_arrival_count, fill=Airlines))+
         geom_col(position="dodge")
```

(4) Your code should be in an R Markdown file, posted to rpubs.com, and should include narrative
descriptions of your data cleanup work, analysis, and conclusions. Please include in your
homework submission:
 The URL to the .Rmd file in your GitHub repository. and
 The URL for your rpubs.com web page.

## Conclusion

**The data frame provided on the arrival times of different airlines in different locations had to be tidy in order to analyze. Using a few functions from tidyverse and dplyr, I was able to tidy the data and filter out the only data I needed to make my analysis on the delayed flights. Based on the average of flights arrivals I was able to see that the flight with the most delays was AM West and major of it's delayed occurred in Phoenix. Alaska seemed to have the lowest delay in Phoenix, while ti has the highest delay in Seattle. Therefore the best airline to use for Phoneix would be Alaska and the best for Seattle would be AM West.**
